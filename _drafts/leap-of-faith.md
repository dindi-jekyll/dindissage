I have wanted to, maybe even needed to blog for a long time. What stopped me? &nbsp;I stopped myself, fool that I am. I always found an excuse to put it off. I think what I was shying away from was the fact that to do it properly to move your business forward you need to be disciplined and committed. I have now decided to jump head long into those commitments.

So look out world here I come. I will try my hardest to be in equal parts entertaining and informative topped with honesty and integrity.&nbsp;
